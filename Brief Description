Map-Reduce Paradigm C++, Parallel Programming

• CLI application designed to find the perfect powers from an immense set of input files and count the distinct values
of each exponent
• Given a file which contains the several file names and the files enumerated in the main file - all containing numbers
to be processed, the program outputs the lists of powers for each exponent from 0 to a number specified by the user
in the command line
• For a better scalability the several files containing numbers are dinamically dispersed among a number of threads
specified by the user in the command line
